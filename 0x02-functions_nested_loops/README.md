1. A function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.Prototype: void print_alphabet(void); and the _putchar was only used twice in my code.

2. A function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line. Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void); and the _putchar was only used twice in my code.

3. A function that checks for lowercase character. Prototype: int _islower(int c); Returns 1 if c is lowercase and Returns 0 otherwise.

4. A function that checks for alphabetic character. Prototype: int _isalpha(int c); Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase and Returns 0 otherwise

5. A function that prints the sign of a number. Prototype: int print_sign(int n); Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero, Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero and Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero

6. A function that computes the absolute value of an integer. Prototype: int _abs(int);

7. A function that prints the last digit of a number. Prototype: int print_last_digit(int); Returns the value of the last digit
